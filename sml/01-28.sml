 * 1.28  Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists
 * a) We suppose that a list (InList) contains elements that are lists

 * 
 * Example:
 * ?- lsort([[a,b,c],[d,e],[f,g,h],[d,e],[i,j,k,l],[m,n],[o]],L).
 * L = [[o], [d, e], [d, e], [m, n], [a, b, c], [f, g, h], [i, j, k, l]]
 * 
 * b) Again, we suppose that a list (InList) contains elements that are lists
 * themselves. But this time the objective is to sort the elements of InList
 * according to their length frequency; i.e. in the default, where sorting is
 * done ascendingly, lists with rare lengths are placed first, others with a
 * more frequent length come later.
 * 
 * Example:
 * ?- lfsort([[a,b,c],[d,e],[f,g,h],[d,e],[i,j,k,l],[m,n],[o]],L).
 * L = [[i, j, k, l], [o], [a, b, c], [f, g, h], [d, e], [d, e], [m, n]]
 * 
 * Note that in the above example, the first two lists in the result L have
 * length 4 and 1, both lengths appear just once. The third and forth list have
 * length 3; there are two list of this length. And finally, the last three
 * lists have length 2. This is the most frequent length.
